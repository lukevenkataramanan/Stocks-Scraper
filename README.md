# Stocks-Scraper
I created a webscraper that collects data from the Stock Market. It utilizes Python and the requests and BeautifulSoup modules to perform its webscraping.

I currently am an active investor in the stock market, so I put my webscraping skills up to the test, and I scraped finance.yahoo.com for my data. At a given time, it shows the user the price of 1 share of a certain stock, as well as a list of Trending Stocks.

This program tested my knowledge of HTML, stocks, and requests, and it was a lot of fun!
